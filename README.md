## Requirements

* iOS 4.3 or later
    * Xcode 4.5 can run this app using the iPhone 6 Simulator.
    * Previous versions of Xcode can run this app in the iPhone 4 and iPhone 5 Simulators.

## History

This app was created in about 2 weeks (in Nov 2011) as an experiment to test cross-marketing for the Park Place iOS app. We certainly got a lot of local press coverage at the time:

* [Kiro News]&nbsp;(TV segment)
* [The Seattle Times]
* [CBS Seattle]
* [TechFlash]
* [Geekwire]

This app was posted on the iTunes App Store between Dec 2011 and approximately Nov 2012. It is no longer offered for sale since it is not being maintained.
